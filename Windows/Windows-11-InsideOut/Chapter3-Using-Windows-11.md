## Lab 3.1: Customizing the Start Menu

The Start menu is your central hub for apps and files. You can pin frequently used items and organize them into folders to keep things tidy.

### Procedure

1. **Pinning Apps**: 
   - Open the Start menu and click **All apps** at the top right.
   - Right-click an app you use often (like Calculator or Notepad) and select **Pin to Start**.

2. **Organizing with Folders**:
   - In the "Pinned" section, click and drag one app icon directly onto another.
   - Windows creates a folder automatically. Click the folder to open it, then click **Edit name** to give it a descriptive label like "Tools" or "Office".

3. **Adjusting the Layout**:
   - Go to **Settings > Personalization > Start**.
   - Pick "More pins", "Default", or "More recommendations". This changes how much space goes to pinned apps versus recent files.

   - Right-click an empty space on the taskbar and select **Taskbar settings**.
   - Scroll down to **Taskbar behaviors** and change **Taskbar alignment** from "Center" to "Left" if you prefer the classic Windows look.

## Lab 3.6: Arranging Windows (Snap Layouts)

Organizing multiple windows is easy with Snap Layouts. You can split your screen into halves, thirds, or quadrants without dragging windows manually.

### Procedure

1. **Using Snap Layouts**:
   - Hover your mouse over the **Maximize** button of any window. 
   - A grid of layout options pops up. Click a zone to snap the window there.

2. **Snap Assist**:
   - Once you snap one window, **Snap Assist** shows your other open windows. Click one to fill the remaining space.

3. **Snap Groups**:
   - If you've snapped windows together, hover over the icon of one of those apps on the taskbar. You'll see the individual window preview AND the **Snap Group**. Click the group to bring back the whole layout at once.
